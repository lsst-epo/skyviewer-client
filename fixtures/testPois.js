      "<p>The Crab Nebula, M1, was the first nebulous object observed by Charles Messier. It is a cloud of expanding gas left over from a supernova explosion. In the center of this nebula is a 16th magnitude star that is the collapsed core of the supernova. It is a pulsar, perhaps even a rotating neutron star. M1 can be seen easily with a pair of binoculars. A telescope will bring out more of the nebula’s fine details.</p>",

      "<p>Known more commonly as the Lagoon Nebula, M8 is a beautiful cloud of gas illuminated by a 5.9 magnitude star inside. The nebula is about 150 light-years in diameter and lies about 5,200 light-years from Earth. M8 is a stellar nursery where many new stars are being formed from the great clouds of gas. With a visual magnitude of 6, this nebula can be easily seen in the constellation of Sagittarius with the naked eye on a dark, clear night. A telescope will reveal some of the more complex patterns of bright and dark areas within the nebula.</p>",

      "<p>M16 is an open star cluster and cloud of hot gas about 7,000 light-years away in the constellation Serpens. It contains a diffuse nebula and several dark dust lanes known as the Eagle Nebula. The name comes from the shape of the nebula, which resembles a flying eagle. The stars in the cluster formed from the gases in this nebula, and new stars are still in the process of forming. This bright object can easily be seen with any optical instrument. Color photographs will show off the bright red color of the nebula.</p>",

    description:
      "<p>The Trifid Nebula, M20, is probably best known for its three-lobed appearance. The dark areas are lanes of dark dust that obscure the nebula’s light. This diffuse nebula is very large, and is located about 5,000 light-years from Earth. It is illuminated by a hot 7th-magnitude star located deep within. M20 is a magnificent object easily visible with a pair of binoculars. The dark rifts that divide the nebula can be seen in a small telescope. Photographs will show the nebula’s bright red, pink, and blue colors.</p>",
