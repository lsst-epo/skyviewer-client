This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, get the node stuff you need:

```bash
yarn
```

Create `.env.local` file in the project root, copy the contents of `.example.env` and uncomment the API URLs to use a local [skyviewer-api](https://github.com/lsst-epo/skyviewer-api) instance

Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development

Lint your code:

```bash
yarn lint
```

Fix your code styles:

```bash
yarn fix
```

## Build

```bash
yarn bs
```
